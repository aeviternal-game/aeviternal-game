### Dev philosophy
I think we start by programming in a non-efficient way. Sort of a 'naive' way. So, do it in a way that most resembles the tabletop game.

Then I think we will optimise after the coding has been finished, because we'll have a much better idea of what's good and possible.

### Ideas
- Allow players to pick up cards after they've put them down? Hmm perhaps not... Does it line up with fates' abilities? Perhaps yes... Perhaps they can play around with the string but once they hit "next phase" the string is set...? Maybe make some sort of 'thread cutting' or 'thread spinning' noise at the end of each phase?
